      description: Deletes a health check. Send a DELETE request to the/2013-04-01/healthcheck/health
        check ID            resource.ImportantAmazon Route 53 does not prevent you
        from deleting a health check even if the health check isassociated with one
        or more resource record sets. If you delete a health check and you don'tupdate
        the associated resource record sets, the future status of the health check
        can't bepredicted and may change. This will affect the routing of DNS queries
        for your DNS failoverconfiguration. For more information, see Replacing and
        Deleting Health Checks in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
